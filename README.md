# Simple Redirect

The purpose of this task was a basic rundown on how to go from one site to another. When the user clicks on one of the images, it will take them from that site to the 
site corresponding with the image shown.

## Purpose

I chose this task as I always forgot how to redirect myself to other sites when clicking buttons/images. So this is something I want newcomers to always remember.
